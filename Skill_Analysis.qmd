# Skill Evaluation 

## Marco's Skills Evaluation 
This radar chart illustrates Marco’s self-assessed proficiency across a broad range of analyst-related skills. Overall, he demonstrates strong capabilities in **communication, problem solving, detail orientation, leadership, and research, each rated at level 4**, highlighting excellent readiness for collaborative work, analytical thinking, and stakeholder engagement.

Marco shows moderate competence in management, Microsoft Excel, data visualization, and presentations, with scores around level 3, indicating a solid foundation in core business skills and common data workflows.

On the technical side, his proficiency in **Python, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, statistics, and data management mostly falls between levels 2 and 3**, suggesting basic familiarity with these critical tools. Developing deeper technical expertise through targeted training, certifications, or applied project work would help strengthen his profile for data-intensive roles.

In summary, Marco combines strong soft skills, high logical thinking, and business-focused capabilities. If technical skills were further developed, he would be especially well suited for roles that emphasize stakeholder engagement, problem solving, and translating data insights into strategic recommendations.



### Millie's Skills Evaluation 
This radar chart illustrates Millie’s self-assessed proficiency across a range of analyst-related skills. Overall, she demonstrates strong capabilities in **communication, management, and Microsoft Excel, each rated at 4**, indicating solid workplace readiness and strong collaboration skills.

Millie also shows competence in areas like data management, data visualization, problem solving, and leadership, with scores generally around 3, suggesting she has a solid foundation in analytical thinking and business-related soft skills.

On the technical side, her proficiency in tools such as **SQL, Python, Tableau, Power BI, and statistics ranges between 2 and 3**, reflecting basic familiarity with room for growth. These skills can be strengthened through hands-on project work or further technical training.

In summary, Millie is a promising early-career analyst with strong soft skills and business tool proficiency, and she is actively developing her technical analytics skillset. She would thrive in roles that bridge communication and data, with clear potential to grow into a well-rounded data analyst.

#### Summary 
Based on the skill assessment results, Marco and Millie are able to clearly identify their strengths and areas for improvement. This evaluation provides a valuable foundation for them to take targeted actions—whether by enhancing technical skills through training or leveraging existing strengths in communication and management to further optimize their capabilities and better align with their career goals.

# Kmeans clustering for NAICS2_NAME skills (for Analyst position)
![Select Two Way Find Best K](output/Find_best_K.png)


![Select (LOT_NAME_SPECIFIC) Mean Salary & Job Demand](output/Kmeans_clustering_for_skills.png) 

This figure reveals how different skill groups correspond to analyst positions. This insight helps align training, hiring, and upskilling strategies with industry-specific needs. 

Cluter 0 - Management, Data, Business, Analytics
Positions in this group tend to **emphasize management and business logic skills**. Positions may focus on data-driven decision making, project coordination, and report analysis. People with **logical thinking and business sensitivity** have a competitive advantage in this group.

Cluster 1 — Administrative and Office Support Skills (Microsoft, Data, Management, Excel, PowerPoint)
This group clearly prefers office **practical skills and tool operation capabilities**. This type of position has lower technical requirements and places more **emphasis on detail processing and internal communication skills**.

Cluster 2 — Hybrid Skill Group (Data, Management, Language, Programming, Business)
This is a group with **obvious cross-skills, integrating data analysis, management, language communication and basic programming skills**. Language skills and diverse backgrounds are particularly important in this group, suitable for people with communication skills + elementary programming + business perception.

Cluster 3 — Technology-oriented group 
This group is obviously **highly technical, covering core skills (such as Programming, Python, and SQL.)** These positions usually require strong programming and logic skills and suitable for computer, statistics, engineering backgrounds or those who have completed technical transformation training.


#  Random Forest 

## Model Design Process

Below is an illustration of how the Random Forest model was designed in order to predict the salary of an analyst position based on a list of skills.

![](output/figures/RF_slide.png) 

## Performance and Assessment

After developing the model we assessed its performance using the following metrics:

        RMSE: $24,094.44
        Interpretation: Predicted salaries deviate from actual salaries by approximately $24,094. Lower RMSE indicates better accuracy.

        R²: 0.635
        Interpretation: The model explains 63.5% of the variation in salaries based on the input features. Higher R² reflects stronger predictive power.

        Predicted Salary: $91,979.83
        Skills used: ["communication", "time_management", "team_leadership", "problem_solving", "critical_thinking","detail_oriented", "innovation", "data_analysis", "statistical_modeling", "dashboard", "power_bi", "etl",
        "python_", "sql_", "microsoft_excel"]

## Strategic Use of the Random Forest Model

The Random Forest regression model estimated an expected salary of $91,979.83 using a defined set of 15 skills transformed into binary vector inputs. The RMSE of approximately $24,094 indicates individual salaries may differ substantially due to unmeasured factors. However, the R² value of 0.635 demonstrates that the model is able to capture over 60% of the variation in salaries even with the limited focus on skills alone.

From the beginning, this model was designed to facilitate actionability in the short term. That is why other features such as education level and minimum years of experience were not considered, because they wouldn't be something that could be easily changed. However, location data (state) was tested as this is a decision one could make when searching for jobs but ultimately excluded because it reduced model performance and added complexity without a proportional gain in precision. The emphasis on modifiable inputs—skills rather than static traits—enables actionable insights for users who want to understand how improving competencies can impact compensation over time. Additionally, selecting only the top 100 skills from the dataset enhances the model's performance and the users' benefit from it.

Overall, the model functions as a practical guidance tool, as envisioned, rather than a pinpoint prediction. It offers a way to inform career planning, prioritize skill development, and benchmark earning potential, providing directional insights (a compass) rather than precise estimates (a coordinate).
